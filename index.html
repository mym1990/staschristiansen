                        <p class="firstaboutme"> I am an up and coming web developer and photographer, a coffee addict, a Christmas tree lover. I love creating, building, capturing, architecting. My love for developement not only comes from the thrill of designing new things but also from being able to pass on to users an experience, a journey, not just another website to visit. I do hope you enjoy mine.</p>

                            <h4 class="skilltitle">UX/UI Design</h4>
                            <p>I love nothing more than stumbling into products that possess intuitive design and provide a seamless user experience. As such, I also strive to incorporate the same qualities into the work I do for both myself and my clients. I believe in simple but refined designs, with slight attention to detail in order to create distinction. </p>

                            <h4 class="skilltitle">Web Development</h4>
                            <p>Solid foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows me to bridge the gap between design and implementation process. Architecting systems that give users a functional end point is extremely important to me. As the web shifts to a more mobile environment, I am also focusing more and more on delivering highly responsive layouts. </p>

                            <h4 class="skilltitle">Photography</h4>
                            <p>I have been doing photography as a hobby for almost four years now, and have recently branched out into doing small commercial gigs such as wedding engagement shoots! My favorite photos are landscapes, and you can check out some of my work by clicking the camera icon up above! I shoot with a Nikon D800, and my favorite lens is definitely the 50mm 1.4.</p>

                            <p>SQL is one of the more developing skills in my toolbelt, but I have experience with SQL queries, MongoDB, and SQL Server. I am very interested in data, so I foresee that SQL will play a part in my future!</p>

                            <h4 class="skilltitle">Data Visualization</h4>
                            <p>While studying business economics at Georgia State, I developed a keen interest for data management and analytics. The advent of many different tools such as D3.js has opened the door further for me to be able to visualize data in never before seen ways. I am actively working on side projects involving data visualization, and those projects should materialize on this site over time! </p>

                            <p>I've been hard pressed to meet many developers who don't consider themselves heavy consumers of the substance, but my friends will confess that I have taken this hobby to a new level. I don't consider myself a particular 'connoisseur', as I get many wild eyed looks for pinning Dunkin' Donuts as my favorite source, but to each his/her own!   </p>
